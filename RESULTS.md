1. ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals Recap
The objective of this assignment was to explore the implementation of Large Language Models (LLMs) using open-source tools and repositories. Our goal was to understand the installation, integration, and testing of an LLM application. We chose to implement a lightweight version of GPT-2, called TinyGPT2, to demonstrate the core functionalities of a text generation model with minimal resource requirements.

2. âœ… Qualitative Results
  Usability: The installation process was smooth using Python virtual environments and pip. The setup instructions were clearly documented in the README.md..

  Performance: TinyGPT2 runs efficiently on CPU, making it ideal for low-resource environments. While it lacks the depth of larger models, it generates coherent text for simple prompts.

  Accuracy: For basic queries and short text generation tasks, TinyGPT2 provides reasonable outputs. Itâ€™s not suitable for complex reasoning or long-form generation.

  Robustness: The model handles typical prompts well. Edge cases like ambiguous or nonsensical inputs result in generic responses, which is expected for small models.

3. ðŸ§  Lessons Learned
This project helped us understand the internal mechanics of LLMs, including tokenization, model loading, and inference. We gained hands-on experience with HuggingFace Transformers and LangChain, and learned how to deploy a minimal chatbot using TinyGPT2.
